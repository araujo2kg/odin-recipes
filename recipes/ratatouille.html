    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ratatouille is a French Provencal dish that consists of stewed vegetables. Though recipes and ingredients vary, there are some ingredients that are almost always used: eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini, onions, and bell peppers. This ratatouille recipe is my version of the terrific French vegetable stew made with fresh tomatoes and lots of summer vegetables. It's very versatile side dish and makes a delicious vegetarian main dish, too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 zucchini, sliced</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>1 green or red bell pepper, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom and sides of a 1 ½-quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant and golden brown. Add eggplant and parsley; cook and stir until eggplant is tender and soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Spread eggplant mixture evenly across the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Spread zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper, covering each layer with a sprinkling of salt and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
